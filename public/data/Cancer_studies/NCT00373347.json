The currently used blood marker for the clinical diagnosis of liver cancer is alpha-feto protein (AFP), which misses 40-60% of patients with liver cancer because it lacks sufficient specificity and sensitivity. The purpose of this study is to identify blood markers that have the ability to diagnose liver cancer with improved accuracy, so that it can be used alone or in conjunction with AFP. The aim of this study is to identify new blood markers of liver cancer that can be used to increase the rate of accurate diagnosis of this malignancy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Liver Cancer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"blood"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":300,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Identify new blood markers of liver cancer","description":"Blood specimens collected through another protocol, Patients would have signed informed consent for that protocol, and agreed to have their blood specimens stored for future research such as this one.","timeFrame":"upto 12 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients diagnosed with liver cancer based on biopsy or serum AFP level, associated with characteristic hypervascular liver tumors on triphasic spiral CT scan or MRI.\n* Patients with non-cancer liver conditions such as cirrhosis, adenoma, cholangioma, or nodular hyperplasia.\n* Patients with hepatitis B or hepatitis C viral infections not associated with liver cancer.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n-Patients will be excluded if, upon looking through their medical records, information required for data analysis are missing.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients diagnosed with liver cancer","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Mei-Sze Chua","role":"CONTACT","phone":"650-724-3525","email":"mchua@stanford.edu"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Samuel So","affiliation":"Stanford University","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Stanford University School of Medicine","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Stanford","state":"California","zip":"94305","country":"United States","contacts":[{"name":"Mei-Sze Chua","role":"CONTACT","phone":"650-724-3525","email":"mchua@stanford.edu"},{"name":"Cancer Clinical Trials Office","role":"CONTACT","phone":"(650) 498-7061"},{"name":"Samuel So","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":37.42411,"lon":-122.16608}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-08-28"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000006528","term":"Carcinoma, Hepatocellular"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000002277","term":"Carcinoma"},{"id":"D000009375","term":"Neoplasms, Glandular and Epithelial"},{"id":"D000009370","term":"Neoplasms by Histologic Type"},{"id":"D000009369","term":"Neoplasms"},{"id":"D000000230","term":"Adenocarcinoma"},{"id":"D000008113","term":"Liver Neoplasms"},{"id":"D000004067","term":"Digestive System Neoplasms"},{"id":"D000009371","term":"Neoplasms by Site"},{"id":"D000004066","term":"Digestive System Diseases"},{"id":"D000008107","term":"Liver Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M5534","name":"Carcinoma","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9613","name":"Carcinoma, Hepatocellular","asFound":"Hepatocellular Carcinoma","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M11113","name":"Liver Neoplasms","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12320","name":"Neoplasms, Glandular and Epithelial","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12315","name":"Neoplasms by Histologic Type","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M3585","name":"Adenocarcinoma","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M8886","name":"Gastrointestinal Neoplasms","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M7256","name":"Digestive System Neoplasms","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M8883","name":"Gastrointestinal Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M7255","name":"Digestive System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M11107","name":"Liver Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC04","name":"Neoplasms"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC06","name":"Digestive System Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
