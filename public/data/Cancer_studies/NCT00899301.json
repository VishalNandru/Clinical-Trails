Archival tissue may also be collected. Patients and normal volunteers also undergo blood and urine sample collection. A repository of tissue, blood, and urine samples will be established to facilitate current and future research studies to learn about the biologic features of breast cancer development and progression. Research studies may include molecular pathology studies and gene and protein expression studies.\n\nPatients' medical records are reviewed over approximately 5 years to determine if the test results are associated with health status. Patients do not receive the results of individual testing."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Breast Cancer"],"keywords":["breast cancer","stage IA breast cancer","stage IB breast cancer","stage II breast cancer","stage IIIA breast cancer","stage IIIB breast cancer","stage IIIC breast cancer","stage IV breast cancer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":4000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Patients with Breast Cancer","interventionNames":["Other: biologic sample preservation procedure"]},{"label":"Patients without breast cancer","interventionNames":["Other: biologic sample preservation procedure"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"biologic sample preservation procedure","description":"Tissue, urine and blood collection.","armGroupLabels":["Patients with Breast Cancer","Patients without breast cancer"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Creation of a tissue repository that contains DNA, RNA, or protein from tumor tissue or normal tissue, peripheral blood lymphocytes, and plasma that are linked to frozen and/or paraffin-embedded pathology specimens","timeFrame":"5 years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"* Breast lesion which is suspected to be cancer or a known diagnosis of breast cancer (any stage, at any point in the disease trajectory) who agrees to donate tissue/body fluids.\n* Individuals of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this trial.
