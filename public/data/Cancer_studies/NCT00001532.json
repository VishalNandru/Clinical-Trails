Specifically, the quantitative computer aided detection of lung CT abnormalities from LAM can be compared to assess whether low radiation dose CT exams is an alternative to conventional CT to monitor disease\n\nstatus.\n\nThis optional sub-study will be offered to up to 100 adult subjects with lung disease and up to 50 children age 9 and older with CF. Children will not be enrolled in the optional CT sub-study unless they have had a standard CT scan for medical purposes to use in comparison. One additional low dose radiation CT scan of the chest may be done as part of this sub-study when these subjects have their next annual CT scan.","detailedDescription":"This study is designed to evaluate genetic mechanisms of lung disease by surveying polymorphic genes involved in respiratory function and examining gene expression in the lung cells of individuals with pulmonary disease (e.g., alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, sarcoidosis, history of infection, and genetic mutations consistent with lung pathology). Emphasis will be on defining the distribution of allelic variants of nitric oxide synthase, alpha 1-antitrypsin, and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator genes in patients and in age- and sex-matched healthy individuals in a control population."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cystic Fibrosis","Pulmonary Fibrosis","Tuberous Sclerosis","Asthma","Pulmonary Sarcoidosis"],"keywords":["Genetic Polymorphism","Nitric Oxide Synthesis","Alpha 1-Antitrypsin","Candidate Genes","Lung Pathology","Natural History","Lung Disease","Cystic Fibrosis","Asthma"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":3500,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"1","description":"Subjects with pulmonary disease or possible pulmonary disease and Relatives"},{"label":"2","description":"Healthy"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"evaluating the role of hereditary factor","description":"distribution of genetic variants of nitric oxide synthases and other candidate genes involved in pulmonary function","timeFrame":"1 year"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"low dose radiation CT scan, and Zoom Scan","description":"The secondary scan can also be used to obtain a detailed assessment of AML-like tumors and lymphangioleiomyomas in the abdomen or pelvis region when they are detected in the standard chest-abdomen-pelvis CT scan.

Children with cystic fibrosis over eight years of age may be included.\n\nPatients with established diagnoses of sarcoidosis; mycobacterial infections; TSC (definite or possible); cystic lung diseases including genetic diseases; lymphangioleiomyomatosis or diseases associated with lymphatic disorders; history of pneumothorax; pulmonary fibrosis; asthma; histiocytosis X and diabetes mellitus will be included in this protocol. Relatives of patients may also be seen under this protocol. Children with lymphangiomatosis who are two years of age or older may be included. Participants with asthma may be enrolled at Suburban Hospital.\n\nResearch volunteers in the pulmonary control group are defined as individuals with no pulmonary disease (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis without evidence of pulmonary disease). Research volunteers in the diabetes control group are defined as individuals with no history of diabetes, coronary artery disease, or pulmonary disease.\n\nPregnant and or nursing women can be included in accordance with Federal Regulations at Subpart B of 45 CFR 46. Subjects who are pregnant and or nursing will be excluded from procedures during their pregnancy that are greater than minimal risk, until they are no longer pregnant and/or nursing. Procedures that will not be completed while the subject is pregnant and/or nursing including: PFTs, Six Minute Walk Test, thoracentesis, bronchoscopy, and measurements with imaging modalities requiring contrast or with radiation exposure such as Chest x-ray, CT scan, MRI. Allowing subjects to be included in the study may glean important information about individuals with uncommon pulmonary disease during and post pregnancy.\n\nPatients with abnormalities in ADP-ribosyltransferases, ADP-ribosyl-acceptor hydrolases, and their substrates. Children who are two years of age or older may be studied if they have a known defect in ADP-ribosylation, or if they have a family member with a defect in ADP-ribosylation and may be affected.\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\nExclusion criteria for all participants include:\n\n1. age less than 18 or greater than 90 except for NIH patients with diseases /disorders as described in this protocol (except cystic fibrosis, lymphangiomatosis or defects in ADP-ribosylation) who are 16 years of age or older, patients with cystic fibrosis who are over eight years of age, patients who are two years of age or older with lymphangiomatosis or a known defect in ADP-ribosylation, or who have a family member with a defect in ADP-ribosylation, or unless patient-specific IRB approval is obtained and;\n2. inability to obtain reliable pulmonary function testing. As clarification, healthy volunteers, relatives of patients (except as noted for an ADP-ribosylation defect), and asthmatic patients from Suburban Hospital will be excluded if less than 18 or greater than 90 years of age.\n\nExclusion criteria for participating in the bronchoscopy portion of the study are:\n\n1. presence of any contraindication for fiberoptic bronchoscopy, with lavage and/or bronchial brushing;\n2. advanced stage of a pulmonary or a systemic illness such that the risk is judged to be significant even in the absence of a specific contraindication to the procedure\n3. allergy to topical anesthetic (e.g., lidocaine)\n4. current or recent respiratory infection (within the last 4 weeks)\n5. pregnancy or lactation\n6. age less than 18 or greater than 65.","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"2 Years","maximumAge":"90 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"individuals with pulmonary disease (e.g., alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, sarcoidosis,Wegener s Granulomatosis,Mycobacterium Avium, Tuberous Sclerosis Complex, other cystic lung diseases, lymphangioleiomyomatosis and diseases associated with lymphatic disorders, or history of pneumothorax, history of infection, and genetic mutations consistent with lung pathology)","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Tatyana Worthy, R.N.","role":"CONTACT","phone":"(301) 827-1376","email":"worthyt@mail.nih.gov"},{"name":"Joel Moss, M.D.","role":"CONTACT","phone":"(301) 496-1597","email":"mossj@nhlbi.nih.gov"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Joel Moss, M.D.","affiliation":"National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Suburban Hospital","status":"COMPLETED","city":"Bethesda","state":"Maryland","zip":"20814","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":38.98067,"lon":-77.10026}},{"facility":"National Institutes of Health Clinical Center","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Bethesda","state":"Maryland","zip":"20892","country":"United States","contacts":[{"name":"Tatyana Worthy, B.S.","role":"CONTACT","phone":"301-827-1376","email":"worthyt@mail.nih.gov"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":38.98067,"lon":-77.10026}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"2370574","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Rybicki BA, Beaty TH, Cohen BH.
