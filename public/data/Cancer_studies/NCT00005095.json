Participants may have samples of blood, tissue, or body fluids (such as ascites, pleural fluid or urine), or any combination of the aforementioned samples obtained to develop tumor markers to detect early stage or recurrent ovarian cancer.\n\nThe results from the biomarker research studies will not be reported to the patient or the physician. In the future, if any of the experimental tumor markers are found to be effective in detecting early stage ovarian cancer, and the patient's result is abnormal, the patient and physician will be notified.\n\nSubjects may be asked to complete a combination of questionnaires designed to evaluate psychological functioning among women enrolled in a comprehensive ovarian cancer early detection program who are at increased risk for developing disease as compared to women currently diagnosed with ovarian cancer."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Cervical Cancer","Endometrial Cancer","Fallopian Tube Cancer","Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer (brca1, brca2)","Ovarian Cancer","Sarcoma","Uterine Leiomyomata","Vaginal Cancer","Vulvar Cancer"],"keywords":["ovarian epithelial cancer","hereditary breast/ovarian cancer (BRCA1, BRCA2)","fallopian tube cancer","ovarian germ cell tumor","ovarian sarcoma","ovarian stromal cancer","endometrial cancer","uterine sarcoma","vaginal cancer","cervical cancer","vulvar cancer","uterine leiomyomata"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"Subject's blood and other specimens are collected their follow-up clinic appointments, as needed"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":6000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"High Risk for Ovarian Cancer","description":"Women who are at increased risk of ovarian cancer based on family or personal medical history who are participating in the Northwestern Ovarian Cancer Early Detection and Prevention Program clinic.","interventionNames":["Other: Ca-125","Other: screening questionnaire administration","Procedure: Surgery"]},{"label":"Suspected or diagnosed gynecological condition","description":"Women who are planning to undergo surgery for their gynecological condition"},{"label":"Control Group","description":"Healthy subjects with no history of cancer and at general risk."}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Ca-125","description":"Subject's blood collected at their follow-up blood draw will be assessed for biomarkers that could lead to a panel for detecting early stage ovarian cancer.","armGroupLabels":["High Risk for Ovarian Cancer"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"screening questionnaire administration","description":"Questionnaires designed to assess quality of life for women at increased risk of ovarian cancer will be administered to the subjects.
