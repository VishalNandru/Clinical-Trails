Lung tissue samples are also collected using fluorescence bronchoscopy and epithelial cell collection.\n\nSamples are studied by genetic and proteomic analyses, including comparative genomic hybridization, expression microarray, and protein profiling."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Lung Cancer"],"keywords":["lung cancer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"Blood, urine, nasal cells, sputum, bronchal epithelial cells, airway tissue, and lung tissue"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":4000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Sample Collection","interventionNames":["Genetic: comparative genomic hybridization","Genetic: gene expression microarray analysis","Genetic: proteomic profiling analysis","Other: biologic sample preservation procedure","Procedure: nasal brushing","Procedure: Blood draw","Procedure: Urine collection","Procedure: sputum sample","Procedure: fluorescence bronchoscopy with airway biopsy","Procedure: fine needle aspiration of the lung","Procedure: thoracentesis"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"GENETIC","name":"comparative genomic hybridization","description":"Collection of sputum, blood, urine, and a small amount of lung tissue.","armGroupLabels":["Sample Collection"]},{"type":"GENETIC","name":"gene expression microarray analysis","description":"Collection of sputum, blood, urine, and a small amount of lung tissue.","armGroupLabels":["Sample Collection"]},{"type":"GENETIC","name":"proteomic profiling analysis","description":"Collection of sputum, blood, urine, and a small amount of lung tissue.","armGroupLabels":["Sample Collection"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"biologic sample preservation procedure","description":"Collection of sputum, blood, urine, and a small amount of lung tissue.","armGroupLabels":["Sample Collection"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"nasal brushing","description":"Using a brush, superficial cells are removed from the nose.","armGroupLabels":["Sample Collection"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Blood draw","description":"Venous blood will be collected","armGroupLabels":["Sample Collection"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Urine collection","description":"Subjects will be asked to provide a urine specimen.","armGroupLabels":["Sample Collection"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"sputum sample","description":"Prior to their bronchoscopy, subjects will be asked for a sputum specimen.
