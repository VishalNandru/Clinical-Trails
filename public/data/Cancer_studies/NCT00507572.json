To collect, both prospectively and retrospectively, data on disease characterization, treatment and outcome for pregnant patients with malignancies seen at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center.\n\nII. To organize clinical information in order to support multifaceted queries of patient characteristics, treatment, and pregnancy outcome data and to facilitate correlation of these characteristics with patient outcome.\n\nIII. To have a single data repository, kept on a secure platform, that will integrate clinical information and research findings and serve as a secure archive for future research.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients' medical records are reviewed prospectively and retrospectively."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Cell Neoplasm","Malignant Solid Neoplasm"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"OTHER"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":500,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Observational (medical chart review)","description":"Patients' medical records are reviewed prospectively and retrospectively.","interventionNames":["Other: Medical Chart Review"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Medical Chart Review","description":"Medical records are reviewed","armGroupLabels":["Observational (medical chart review)"],"otherNames":["Chart Review"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Creation of data repository for patient characteristics, treatment, and pregnancy outcome data","timeFrame":"Up to 15 years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* All pregnant patients with cancer and patients known to have been pregnant with a diagnosis of cancer are eligible, regardless of their diagnosis or treatment plan\n* Patients may receive prenatal care from any obstetrician, but a consult with Maternal Fetal Medicine is encouraged","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"FEMALE","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Pregnant patients with cancer and patients known to have been pregnant with a diagnosis of cancer","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Andrea Milbourne","role":"CONTACT","phone":"713-745-6986","email":"amilbour@mdanderson.org"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Andrea M Milbourne","affiliation":"M.D. Anderson Cancer Center","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"M D Anderson Cancer Center","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Houston","state":"Texas","zip":"77030","country":"United States","contacts":[{"name":"Andrea M.
