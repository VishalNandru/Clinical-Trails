Many of the test performed are in the context of standard medical care that is offered to all patients with thyroid nodules or thyroid cancer. Other tests are performed for research purposes. In addition, blood and tissue samples will be taken for research and genetic studies....","detailedDescription":"The purpose of this study is to gain knowledge and experience in the diagnosis and therapy of thyroid cancer using established best standard of care and new techniques and approaches as they are developed. Study subjects will include adults and children with thyroid nodules requiring diagnostic imaging and fine needle aspiration biopsy, surgery, radioiodine scanning or therapy, appropriate follow up, consisting of tumor markers monitoring and anatomical and functional imaging. The limitations and significance of serum thyroglobulin (Tg) measurement for diagnosing tumor recurrence will be assessed. The study will permit a continued evaluation of the risk/benefit ratio of already established methods of administering radioiodine therapy, including the impact of pre-treatment dosimetric calculations, individualizing treatment with radioiodine. Under this protocol, samples of benign nodules and cancer tissue specimens for research studies will be collected. Data and samples collected during routine clinical care will be used to address research questions utilizing a number of approaches including microscopy, immunohistochemistry, proteomics and molecular analysis. All research studies will relate to the diagnosis, natural history and therapy of thyroid tumors, regulation of thyroid function, and the effects of thyroid function on the body. Blood and urine specimens will be collected for research studies in both the hypothyroid and euthyroid state."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hurthle Cell Thyroid Cancer","Tall Cell Variant Thyroid Cancer","Follicular Thyroid Cancer","Thyroid Cancer","Papillary Thyroid Cancer"],"keywords":["Thyroid Fine Needle Biopsy","Radioiodine","Dosimetry","Natural History"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":2500,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"thyroid cancer","description":"Patients with thyroid cancer","interventionNames":["Drug: 68-Gallium Dotatate"]},{"label":"thyroid nodules","description":"Patients with thyroid nodules","interventionNames":["Drug: 68-Gallium Dotatate"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"68-Gallium Dotatate","description":"For evaluation risk/benefit evaluation","armGroupLabels":["thyroid cancer","thyroid nodules"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Evaluation of thyroid cancer","description":"Blood draws, CT and other scans, physical exams, surgery (if applicable), thyroid biopsy (if applicable).","timeFrame":"As clinically indicated"},{"measure":"Evaluation of thyroid disorders","description":"blood draws, CT and other scans, physical exam.","timeFrame":"As clinically indicated"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"* INCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\nIn order to be eligible to participate in this study, an individual must meet all of the following criteria:\n\n1.
