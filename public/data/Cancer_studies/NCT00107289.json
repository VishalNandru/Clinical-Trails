Three weeks should have elapsed since last dose of chemotherapy.\n* Age \\>1 year with a determination that radiation safety restrictions during therapy period can be implemented.\n* Stem cells: Patients must have an autologous hematopoietic stem cell product cryopreserved and available for re-infusion after MIBG treatment. The minimum dose for peripheral blood stem cells is 2 X106 CD34+ cells/kg.\n* Minimum life expectancy of eight weeks\n* Signed informed consent indicating awareness of the investigational nature of this program.\n\nInclusion criteria for malignant CCT:\n\n* Patients must have the diagnosis of malignant CCT i.e. malignant pheochromocytoma or malignant paraganglioma\n* Patients must have MIBG-avid malignant CCT and evaluable disease on MIBG scan at time of enrollment on protocol\n* Prior Therapy: At least 2 weeks should have elapsed since any biologic therapy.

Specifically, renal, cardiac, hepatic, pulmonary, gastrointestinal and neurologic toxicity should all be grade 2 or less. A grade 3 hearing deficit is acceptable.\n* Active serious infections not controlled by antibiotics.\n* Pregnant women are excluded for fear of danger to the fetus. Therefore negative pregnancy test is required for all women of child-bearing age, and appropriate contraception is used during the study period.\n* Inability or unwillingness to comply with radiation safety procedures or protocol requirements.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"1 Year","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Ellen Basu, MD, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"212-639-5204"},{"name":"Shakeel Modak, MD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"212-639-7623"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Ellen Basu, MD, PhD","affiliation":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center","status":"RECRUITING","city":"New York","state":"New York","zip":"10065","country":"United States","contacts":[{"name":"Ellen Basu, MD, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"212-639-5204"},{"name":"Neeta Pandit-Taskar, MD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"2126393046","email":"pandit-n@MSKCC.ORG"},{"name":"Ellen Basu, MD, PhD","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":40.71427,"lon":-74.00597}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"26773712","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Chu BP, Horan C, Basu E, Dauer L, Williamson M, Carrasquillo JA, Pandit-Taskar N, Modak S.
