Patients also complete a 15- to 30-minute follow up survey at 6 months and 1 year to assess health, health practices, and family history. A review of the patient's medical information is obtained from the medical record.\n\nBlood samples are collected for future research studies. Oral cells and stool samples may also be collected for future studies."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Islet Cell Tumor","Pancreatic Cancer","Pancreatic Disease"],"keywords":["recurrent pancreatic cancer","stage I pancreatic cancer","stage II pancreatic cancer","stage III pancreatic cancer","stage IV pancreatic cancer","recurrent islet cell carcinoma","pancreatic alpha cell carcinoma","pancreatic beta islet cell carcinoma","pancreatic delta cell carcinoma","pancreatic G-cell carcinoma"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"Two 10mL plasma tubes, two 10mL serum tubes and one 10mL heparin tube collected.
