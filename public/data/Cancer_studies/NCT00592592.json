Photon beam radiation is the standard type of radiation for treating most rhabdomyosarcoma and many other types of cancer. Photon beam radiation enters the body and passes through healthy tissue, encounters the tumor, then leaves the body through healthy tissue. A beam of proton radiation enters the body and passes through healthy tissue, encounters tumor, but then stops. This means that less healthy tissue is affected by proton beam radiation than by photon beam radiation.","detailedDescription":"* A special device is made for each participant to help them hold still during the treatment. This may be in the form of a mask or a custom made foam cradle depending on the area to be treated.\n* Radiation treatments will be given once per day, 5 days a week for a total of 4 to 6 weeks, depending upon how much total dose the tumor requires.\n* Participants will be seen once per week by their radiation doctor to monitor health and record any side effects from treatment.\n* After the radiation treatments are completed, participants will be required to undergo further tests and evaluations for several years following treatment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Rhabdomyosarcoma"],"keywords":["pediatric rhabdomyosarcoma","proton radiation therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":110,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Proton Beam Radiation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Proton Beam Radiation","interventionNames":["Radiation: Proton Beam Radiation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"RADIATION","name":"Proton Beam Radiation","description":"Once per day, 5 days a week for a total of 4 to 6 weeks.","armGroupLabels":["Proton Beam Radiation"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Late toxicity","description":"Frequency and severity of late complications from irradiation using proton beam therapy in place of conventional photon beam therapy in pediatric patients with pediatric rhabdomyosarcomas.","timeFrame":"4 years"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Acute toxicity","description":"Frequency and severity of acute side effects from irradiation using proton beam therapy in this patient population.","timeFrame":"4 years"},{"measure":"Dosimetric comparison","description":"Comparison of Dose distribution to tumor and surrounding normal structures using DVH's generated from the proton plan used to treat the patient and the photon plan generated for comparison purposes.","timeFrame":"4 years"},{"measure":"Local Control","description":"Rates of local control using proton radiotherapy.","timeFrame":"4 years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with biopsy proven newly diagnosed rhabdomyosarcoma.\n* Patients less than or equal to 21 years of age.\n* Patients must be treated with a standardly accepted chemotherapy regimen.\n* May not have metastatic disease unless aged 2-10 with embryonal histology.\n* Must be willing to receive follow-up care for a minimum of five years after treatment at MGH and annual visits unless it is too difficult to return to MGH for follow-up care.
