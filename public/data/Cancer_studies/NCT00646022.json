Familial carcinoid tumors usually originate in hormone-producing cells that line the small intestine or other cells of the digestive tract. The tumors are slow-growing and usually take many years before they cause symptoms. It is known that these tumors occur more often in some families and are then passed from one generation to the next by inherited genes.\n\nMembers of families, including all siblings and offspring in which two or more immediate blood relatives have had small bowel carcinoid tumors are eligible for this study. In some cases unaffected spouses of family members diagnosed with carcinoid cancer are also requested to participate by donating a sample of blood only.\n\nParticipants undergo a medical evaluation every 3 years during a 3- to 5-day hospital stay at the NIH Clinical Center. All participants have a personal and family medical history obtained and undergo a physical examination, blood and urine tests.\n\nPeople who already have a small bowel carcinoid tumor or are at risk of developing a carcinoid tumor have some or all of the following procedures to determine the presence of carcinoid tumor and its (omit next two words- location or) spread to other areas of the body:\n\n* Video Capsule Endoscopy: Visualization of the gastrointestinal tract by ingesting a disposable, \"vitamin-pill sized\" video capsule that has its own camera and light source.\n* CT of the chest abdomen and pelvis with oral and IV contrast : X-ray examination of the chest, abdominal and pelvis organs.\n* 18 FDOPA Positron emission tomography (PET) with CT for localization: Nuclear imaging scan to look at tumor activity.\n* MRI Liver with contrast - to determine if disease has spread to liver\n* Gallium 68 PET/CT-limited to individuals that have residual tumor.\n* Clinical and research blood work\n\nShould mid gut carcinoid tumors be found every participant will be assisted in determine what the best course of treatment will be for them.","detailedDescription":"Study Description:\n\nThis study is designed as a prospective evaluation for diagnostic screening, genotyping and natural history of participants belonging to kindreds with familial carcinoid tumor.\n\nObjectives: Primary Objective:\n\nStudy the natural history of familial carcinoid tumors: incidence, age of onset, symptoms, the appropriate diagnostic (biochemical and imaging) modalities, location, histology and metastatic potential of the tumors, metabolic sequelae of the tumor, and clinical and biochemical prognostic factors.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\n* Screen for occult disease and determine whether early detection affects the natural history of the disease.\n* Compare the sensitivity and specificity of various imaging tomography (CT) with IV contrast and oral NewLumEX or 0.1 % barium sulfate suspension, 18F-DOPA PET/CT scan, \\[68Ga\\] DOTATATE PET/CT scan and endoscopic modalities for diagnosing and following carcinoid tumors.\n* Collect tumor specimens for histologic evaluation, culturing of intestinal organoids, and genotyping (including DNA and RNA sequencing).\n* Sequester DNA from peripheral blood for genotyping (including sequencing) with the intention of localizing a susceptibility gene/s responsible for the familial occurrence of the disease."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Carcinoid"],"keywords":["Neuroendocrine","PET","Gastrointestinal","Serotonin","Natural History","Carcinoid Tumor","Gastrointestinal Carcinoid
