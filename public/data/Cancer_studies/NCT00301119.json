Some participants may undergo fiberoptic bronchoscopy based upon CT scan results with transbronchial or endobronchial biopsies. Some participants may undergo lung resection. Tissue samples are collected from surgery or biopsy.\n\nPROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of participants will be accrued for this study."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Lung Cancer"],"keywords":["small cell lung cancer","non-small cell lung cancer","smoker lung cancer screening","low dose spiral CT screening"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"blood serum, plasma, urine, sputum, BAL, lung tissue, buccal swab"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":9350,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"lung cancer screening cohort","description":"observational only. no intervention. current, former and never smokers over age 50 without history of cancer, except for non melanoma skin cancer, no previous treatment with chemotherapy."},{"label":"r/o lung cancer","description":"observational only. no intervention. patients with CT findings suspicious for lung cancer who are undergoing bronchoscopy and/or surgery."}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Lung cancer diagnosis as measured by CT scan findings and pathology findings annually","timeFrame":"07/01/2015"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Precancerous lung nodules as measured by CT scan findings and pathology findings annually","timeFrame":"07/01/2015"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:\n\n* Screening Cohort\n\n  * At high- or low-risk for lung cancer\n  * Smoking history â‰¥ 20 pack years\\*\n\n    * With or without workplace exposure to asbestos\n* NOTE: \\* Participants with \\< 20 pack years of smoking are eligible if 50 years of age or older\n* Rule-Out Lung cancer group\n\n  * Referred for evaluation of suspicious nodules with 1 of the following diagnoses:\n\n    * Lung cancer\n    * Nonmalignant nodules (control group)\n\nPATIENT CHARACTERISTICS:\n\n* Not pregnant\n* No prior malignancy except nonmelanoma skin cancer\n\nPRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY:\n\n* Not specified","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"50 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"healthy subjects at risk for lung cancer and controls from community, private physician referrals, local trade unions, employee health fairs, word of mouth and print advertisements.\n\npatient referrals from physician outpatient offices and inpatients with CT findings suspicious for lung cancer.","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"James J.
