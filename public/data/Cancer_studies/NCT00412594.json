Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cladribine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving cladribine together with rituximab may kill more cancer cells.","detailedDescription":"PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To demonstrate the efficacy in achieving complete response of combination of cladribine administered intravenously over 2 hours for 5 days followed by rituximab weekly for 8 weeks in patients with untreated or previously treated hairy cell leukemia.\n\nII. To examine the efficacy of rituximab to eradicate minimal residual disease (MRD) after cladribine therapy (as assessed by immunophenotyping of bone marrow and peripheral blood).\n\nIII. To examine the effect of addition of rituximab to cladribine on the long term disease-free (DFS) and overall survival (OS) (as compared with historical controls).\n\nIV. To evaluate potential predictors of outcome including molecular and flow evaluations of MRD, as well as other potential molecular predictors such as v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF).\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive cladribine intravenously (IV) over 2 hours once daily (QD) on days 1-5 and rituximab IV once weekly for 8 weeks beginning on day 28 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hairy Cell Leukemia","Recurrent Hairy Cell Leukemia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":150,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Treatment (cladribine and rituximab)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients receive cladribine IV over 2 hours QD on days 1-5 and rituximab IV once weekly for 8 weeks beginning on day 28 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.","interventionNames":["Drug: Cladribine","Other: Laboratory Biomarker Analysis","Biological: Rituximab"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Cladribine","description":"Given IV","armGroupLabels":["Treatment (cladribine and rituximab)"],"otherNames":["2-CdA","2CDA","CdA","Cladribina","Leustat","Leustatin","Leustatine","RWJ-26251"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"Laboratory Biomarker Analysis","description":"Correlative studies","armGroupLabels":["Treatment (cladribine and rituximab)"]},{"type":"BIOLOGICAL","name":"Rituximab","description":"Given IV","armGroupLabels":["Treatment (cladribine and rituximab)"],"otherNames":["ABP 798","BI 695500","C2B8 Monoclonal Antibody","Chimeric Anti-CD20 Antibody","CT-P10","IDEC-102","IDEC-C2B8","IDEC-C2B8 Monoclonal Antibody","MabThera","Monoclonal Antibody IDEC-C2B8","PF-05280586","Rituxan","Rituximab ABBS","Rituximab Biosimilar ABP 798","Rituximab Biosimilar BI 695500","Rituximab Biosimilar CT-P10","Rituximab Biosimilar GB241","Rituximab Biosimilar IBI301","Rituximab Biosimilar JHL1101","Rituximab Biosimilar PF-05280586","Rituximab Biosimilar RTXM83","Rituximab Biosimilar SAIT101","rituximab biosimilar TQB2303","rituximab-abbs","RTXM83","Truxima"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Efficacy of rituximab on achievement of complete response after therapy with cladribine","description":"Defined as the absence of hairy cells in the bone marrow or the presence of less than 1 percent atypical cells and the disappearance of all evidence of hairy cell leukemia on physical examination.
