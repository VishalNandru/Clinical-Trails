Measure standard observer derived outcomes such as morbidity, mortality, tumor recurrence and also patient derived outcomes, in particular quality of life (QOL) using the MOS SF36 questionnaire. Evaluate whether the SF36 will accurately reflect pre and postoperative changes in clinical status in this patient group.Compare the results of this global QOL instrument (SF 36) to disease specific scales of dysphagia and reflux. Assess the impact of adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy on QOL in this patient group and determine if any advantages of MIE can be demonstrated."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Esophagectomy","Esophageal Cancer"],"keywords":["Esophagectomy","Esophageal Cancer","Quality of Life","Minimally Invasive Esophagectomy","Laparoscopic Transhiatal Esophagectomy","Open Esophagectomy","Karnofsky Score","Dysphagia score","Heartburn Scale","Nutrition Score"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":3500,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Questionnaires","description":"Quality of life and heartburn assessment questionnaires are administered preoperatively and at set intervals postoperatively."}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change from baseline in SF36 Quality of Life Questionnaire at 4 month postoperative","description":"The SF36 is an eight dimension Quality of Life Measurement.
