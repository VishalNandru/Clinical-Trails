Bone marrow RNA samples are examined for immunoglobulin light-chain gene sequences and amino acids by polymerase chain reaction and positional cloning. Blood serum and urine samples are evaluated for amyloid protein stability by high-resolution calorimetry, isothermal-titration calorimetry, and far- and near-UV circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy. Urine samples are also examined for post-translational modifications (e.g., glycosylation, sulfation, and cross-linking) to identify common features unique to amyloid proteins. Tissue samples are analyzed for biochemical and biophysical properties and for post-translational modifications in light chains.\n\nQuality of life is assessed by the 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Multiple Myeloma"],"keywords":["primary systemic amyloidosis"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"blood, urine, and tissue"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":10000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"GENETIC","name":"clonality analysis","description":"analyze clonality"},{"type":"GENETIC","name":"polymerase chain reaction","description":"analyze polymerase chain reaction"},{"type":"GENETIC","name":"protein analysis","description":"analyze protein"},{"type":"OTHER","name":"biologic sample preservation procedure","description":"preserve biologic samples"},{"type":"OTHER","name":"laboratory biomarker analysis","description":"analyze laboratory biomarkers"},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"fluorescence spectroscopy","description":"perform fluorescence spectroscopy on specimens"},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"quality-of-life assessment","description":"assess quality of life at each follow-up for life"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Establish a repository to promote biochemical research","timeFrame":"life of study"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Collection of clinical material and information","timeFrame":"life of study"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\nDISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:\n\n* Diagnosis or suspicion of amyloidosis\n\nPATIENT CHARACTERISTICS:\n\n* Referred to the Amyloid Treatment and Research Center at Boston University Medical Center\n\nPRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY:\n\n* Not specified\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nNone","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Participants diagnosed, or with suspicion of having, amyloidosis","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Vaishali Sanchorawala, MD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"617-638-8261","email":"vaishali.sanchorawala@bmc.org"},{"name":"Annie Jose, BS","role":"CONTACT","phone":"617 638 8213","email":"annie.jose@bmc.org"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Vaishali Sanchorawala, MD","affiliation":"Boston Medical Center","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Boston University Cancer Research Center","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Boston","state":"Massachusetts","zip":"02118","country":"United States","contacts":[{"name":"Clinical Trials Office - Boston University Cancer Research Cen","role":"CONTACT","phone":"617-638-8265"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":42.35843,"lon":-71.05977}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"32130406","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Staron A, Burks EJ, Lee JC, Sarosiek S, Sloan JM, Sanchorawala V.
