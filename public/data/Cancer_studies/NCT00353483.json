The investigators hypothesize that systemic therapy-resistant DTC can be identified by their expression of a unique constellation of tumor marker proteins which may be similar to those expressed by breast cancer stem cells. In this research, the investigators' specific aims are : 1) to characterize tumor markers expressed by DTC which are present after systemic therapy, 2) to compare the expression of these markers to that on DTC detected prior to systemic therapy, 3) to correlate expression of the defined tumor markers on DTC with clinical outcome of breast cancer patients to identify those markers that are predictive of disease recurrence, 4) to utilize biomarkers identified in Specific Aims 1 and 2 to isolate purified DTC for further molecular analysis."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Breast Neoplasms"],"keywords":["Breast Cancer","Neoadjuvant"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"Breast cancer tissue, peripheral blood, and bone marrow"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":300,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Tissue, blood, and bone marrow (optional) collection","description":"* Undergo neoadjuvant systemic therapy\n\n  * initial surgery for sentinel lymph node biopsy/portacath placement\n  * definitive cancer surgery (if applicable)\n  * when portacath is removed (1 year, if available)\n  * if metastatic disease develops or is present in accessible sites, a sample may be collected at the time of specimen collection for diagnosis\n* Undergo Adjuvant Systemic Therapy\n\n  * initial surgery for a sentinel lymph node biopsy/portacath placement\n  * when portacath is removed (1 year, if available)\n  * If metastatic disease develops or is present in accessible sites, a sample may be collected at the time of specimen collection for diagnosis.\n* Undergone neoadjuvant systemic therapy\n\n  * during definitive cancer surgery/portacath removal (if available)\n  * if metastatic disease develops or is present in accessible sites, a sample may be collected at the time of specimen collection for diagnosis","interventionNames":["Procedure: Peripheral blood draw","Procedure: Breast tissue collection","Procedure: Bone marrow biopsy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Peripheral blood draw","armGroupLabels":["Tissue, blood, and bone marrow (optional) collection"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Breast tissue collection","armGroupLabels":["Tissue, blood, and bone marrow (optional) collection"]},{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Bone marrow biopsy","armGroupLabels":["Tissue, blood, and bone marrow (optional) collection"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Characterize tumor markers expressed by DTC which are present after systemic therapy","timeFrame":"Approximately 6 years"},{"measure":"Compare the expression of these markers to that on DTC detected prior to systemic therapy","timeFrame":"Approximately 6 years"},{"measure":"Correlate expression of the defined tumor markers on DTC with clinical outcome of breast cancer patients to identify those markers that are predictive of disease recurrence.","timeFrame":"Approximately 6 years"},{"measure":"Compare the tumor markers present on DTC before and after chemotherapy with the tumor marker expression of the primary tumor and post-treatment tumor.","timeFrame":"Approximately 6 years."},{"measure":"To xenograft tumor cells into mice for further genetic and phenotypic characterization.","timeFrame":"Approximately 6 years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Recently diagnosed with clinical stage II, III, or IV breast cancer\n* Planning to undergo neoadjuvant or adjuvant systemic therapy;
