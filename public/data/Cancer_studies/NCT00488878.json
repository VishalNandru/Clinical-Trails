Collecting information about the type of cancer and treatment, as well as details about follow-up care, may help researchers learn and better understand these tumor types and help develop better treatments for them.","detailedDescription":"PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To collect, both prospectively and retrospectively, data on disease characterization, treatment, and outcomes for approximately 1600 female patients with low-grade ovarian and peritoneal tumors.\n\nII. To organize clinical information in order to support multifaceted queries of patient characteristics, treatment, and disease outcome data and to facilitate correlation of these characteristics with patient outcome.\n\nIII. To have a single data repository, kept on a secure platform that will integrate clinical information and research findings and serve as a secure archive for future research.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To obtain and store human tumor samples in the form of blocks or slides for the purpose of establishing a tumor bank.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients' medical records are reviewed for retrospective and prospective data collection. Patients may also have residual tissue samples collected and stored."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Low Grade Ovarian Serous Adenocarcinoma","Malignant Ovarian Neoplasm","Ovarian Carcinoma","Primary Peritoneal Carcinoma","Primary Peritoneal Low Grade Serous Adenocarcinoma","Psammocarcinoma"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"OTHER"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"Tissue"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":2000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Observational (electronic health record review)","description":"Patients' medical records are reviewed for retrospective and prospective data collection.
