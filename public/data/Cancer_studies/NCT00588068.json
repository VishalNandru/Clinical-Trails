These research studies include surface marker analysis, cytogenetics, cancer genes,genome sequencing, tumor growth-related genes and tumor growth in test tubes. Your blood, marrow, and hematopoietic stem cell samples will also be tested for tumors or leukemia cells, and your serum tested for anti-tumor antibodies.","detailedDescription":"To collect tumor, marrow specimens prospectively to study the molecular-genetic makeup of individual neuroblastic tumor and its metastasis by blood and marrow, and to correlate these findings with clinical outcome, and to relate the signaling circuitry of neuroblastic tumors to that of embryonic neuroectodermal cells. ."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Neuroblastoma"],"keywords":["Adrenal Gland","No stage requirement"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"Tumor, marrow and blood samples"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1500,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"1","description":"Tumor and Marrow Markers","interventionNames":["Other: Tumor and Marrow Markers"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Tumor and Marrow Markers","description":"Tumor and Marrow Markers","armGroupLabels":["1"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"To study the molecular-genetic makeup and metastasis of neuroblastic tumors.","description":"Before surgery a maximum of 5 blood drawings (20-30 ml) will be performed per year (at least one month apart) per patient","timeFrame":"2 years"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"To study the correlation of these biologic markers with clinical outcome.","description":"Before surgery and a maximum of 5 blood drawings (20-30 ml) will be performed per year (at least one month apart) per patient","timeFrame":"2 years"},{"measure":"To relate neuroblastic tumor and embryonic neuroectodermal cell circuitry.","description":"Up to six fetal adrenal samples will be obtained (without patient identifiers) from gestational week 20, when neuroblasts are present and thought to be differentiating within the fetal adrenal gland.","timeFrame":"2 years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Neuroblastic tumors diagnosed in accordance with the International Neuroblastoma Staging System\n\nOR\n\n* Clinically suspected neuroblastic tumors.\n\nPK DRAW INCLUSION CRITERIA (FOR PK DRAWS ONLY):\n\nPK Draw Inclusion Criteria\n\n* Patients who receive naxitamab as part of their standard of care\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* None","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Patients will be offered participation in this study by their attending oncologist in the Department of Pediatrics at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Nai-Kong Cheung, M.D., Ph.D.","role":"CONTACT","phone":"646-888-2313"},{"name":"Shakeel Modak, MD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"212-639-7623"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Nai-Kong Cheung, M.D., Ph.D.","affiliation":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center","status":"RECRUITING","city":"New York","state":"New York","zip":"10065","country":"United States","contacts":[{"name":"Nai-Kong Cheung, M.D., Ph.D.","role":"CONTACT"},{"name":"Nai-Kong Cheung, M.D., Ph.D.","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":40.71427,"lon":-74.00597}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"34550633","type":"DERIVED","citation":"Felix CA, Slater DJ, Davenport JW, Yu X, Gregory BD, Li MM, Rappaport EF, Cheung NV.
