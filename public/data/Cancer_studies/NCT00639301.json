By quality of life, we mean how you are feeling about being satisfied with things in your life, including your physical health, your emotional health, and your ability to carry out daily activities. We hope that this information will help us provide better care to future children with retinoblastoma and better follow-up care for survivors of retinoblastoma."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Retinoblastoma"],"keywords":["Survivor","Quality of Life","Eye"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"RETROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"1","description":"Long term survivors of retinoblastoma","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Questionnaires"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Questionnaires","description":"The survey will be administered by mail or telephone interview, based upon the participant preference.
