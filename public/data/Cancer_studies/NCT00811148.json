The samples will become part of the University of Florida Brain Tumor Tissue Bank/Florida Center for Brain Tumor Research. The goal is to find improved treatments and cures for brain tumors.","detailedDescription":"The mission of the Florida Center for Brain Tumor Research is to discover cures for brain tumors and develop innovative brain tumor treatment modalities by providing a central repository for brain tumor biopsies and clinical information from individuals throughout the state of Florida, improving brain tumor biomedical research programs within the state of Florida, facilitating funding opportunities, fostering collaboration with brain tumor research organizations and other institutions, and fostering improved technology transfer of brain tumor research findings into clinical trials and widespread public use.\n\nThe Florida Center for Brain Tumor Research will collect and store left-over tissue that is not needed for medical care or diagnosis in a tissue bank in the Evelyn F. and William L. McKnight Brain Institute at the University of Florida. Tissue, medical information, cerebrospinal fluid, blood and answers to Quality of Life questionnaires will be stored and made available to researchers. Although developed for Florida, tumor tissue from all other states would be accepted."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Brain Tumors"],"keywords":["Brain Neoplasms","Central Nervous System Diseases","Central Nervous System Neoplasms","Brain Diseases","Nervous System Neoplasms"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"Tissue, medical information, cerebrospinal fluid, blood and answers to Quality of Life questionnaires will be stored and made available to researchers."},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":4000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Tissue Bank","description":"Collection of clinical data and tumor tissue removed during brain surgeries for future research.","interventionNames":["Procedure: Tissue Bank"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Tissue Bank","description":"Collection of clinical data and tumor tissue.","armGroupLabels":["Tissue Bank"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Collect and maintain clinical data and tumor tissue removed during brain surgeries.","timeFrame":"10 Years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Children and adults scheduled to undergo brain surgery to remove tumor tissue.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Children and adults scheduled to undergo brain surgery to remove tumor tissue.","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Kim Foli, BS","role":"CONTACT","phone":"(352) 273-9000","email":"kim.foli@neurosurgery.ufl.edu"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Maryam Rahman, MD","affiliation":"University of Florida","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"University of Florida","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Gainesville","state":"Florida","zip":"32610","country":"United States","contacts":[{"name":"Kim Foli, BS","role":"CONTACT","phone":"352-273-9000","email":"kim.foli@neurosurgery.ufl.edu"},{"name":"Maryam Rahman, MD","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":29.65163,"lon":-82.32483}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-08-28"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000001932","term":"Brain Neoplasms"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000016543","term":"Central Nervous System Neoplasms"},{"id":"D000009423","term":"Nervous System Neoplasms"},{"id":"D000009371","term":"Neoplasms by Site"},{"id":"D000009369","term":"Neoplasms"},{"id":"D000001927","term":"Brain Diseases"},{"id":"D000002493","term":"Central Nervous System Diseases"},{"id":"D000009422","term":"Nervous System Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M5742","name":"Central Nervous System Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5204","name":"Brain Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5209","name":"Brain Neoplasms","asFound":"Brain Tumor","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M12367","name":"Nervous System Neoplasms","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M18937","name":"Central Nervous System Neoplasms","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC10","name":"Nervous System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC04","name":"Neoplasms"}]}},"hasResults":false}
