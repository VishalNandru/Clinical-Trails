One of the unique aspects of the Aquilion ONE CT system is its ability to acquire whole organ volume images in a single rotation by utilizing an x-ray detector that is configured as 320 detector rows with a 0.5 mm width, providing a z-axis coverage of 16 cm of anatomy. In line with the evolutionary changes to CT systems, the Aquilion ONE will be upgraded with new technology that will expand its capabilities. The changes being made to the Aquilion ONE will provide enhancements to image acquisition capabilities, reduce ionizing radiation dose, and improve subject access to the system. All of these features assist in enhancing the safety of the currently installed Aquilion ONE CT system.","armGroupLabels":["LAM"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Define the clinical course of the disease LAM andelucidate the pathogenesis of LAM at cellular and molecular levels","description":"To define the molecular basis of the remarkable proliferation of immature appearing smooth muscle cells, which is the cause of many of the clinical manifestations, and perhaps thereby to improve our understanding of the mechanism of smooth muscle cell proliferation in other diseases, e.g., interstitial lung diseases, asthma, atherosclerosis, hypertension, and post-angioplastic coronary restenosis. To assess the contribution of proteins and genetic factors to cyst formation, airway obstruction, and clinical course. To evaluate the role of TSC genes in the pathogenesis of LAM.","timeFrame":"on going"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"* INCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\nGeneral admission criteria for patients include one or both of the following:\n\nFindings on lung biopsy diagnostic of LAM;\n\nFindings on chest x-ray and/or chest computed axial tomography consistent with LAM.\n\nPatients with TSC and pulmonary LAM will be included in the study.\n\nNormal non-smokers in the control group are defined as individuals who have not smoked for greater than or equal to 1 year and have no systemic or pulmonary disease.\n\nNormal smokers defined as individuals with no systemic or pulmonary disease, who have smoked for greater than or equal to 1 year and have normal chest x-ray and normal pulmonary function tests may be included if needed as controls for a similar population of patients with LAM.\n\nPregnant and or nursing women can be included in accordance with Federal Regulations at Subpart B of 45 CFR 46 Subjects who are pregnant and or nursing will be excluded from procedures during their pregnancy that are greater than minimal risk, until they are no longer pregnant and/or nursing. Procedures that will not be completed while the subject is pregnant and/or nursing including: PFTs, Six Minute Walk Test, thoracentesis, bronchoscopy, and measurements with imaging modalities requiring contrast or with radiation exposure such as Chest x-ray, CT scan, MRI, bone densitometry (DEXA). Allowing subjects to be included in the study may glean important information about individuals with uncommon pulmonary disease during and post pregnancy.\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\nExclusion criteria for patients include:\n\nAge less than 16.\n\nAdvanced stage of a pulmonary or a systemic illness in which the risk of the study is judged to be significant even in the absence of a clear contraindication to the procedures.\n\nExclusion criteria for patients for the formal exercise study and the stress echocardiogram include patients on continuous oxygen. Patients may perform an exercise test that will assess the patient's exercise capacity with activities of daily living.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"16 Years","maximumAge":"100 Years","stdAges":["CHILD","ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Individuals with pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis develop severe destructive lung disease.
