The databank will be used to determine whether familial lymphomas have unique genetic characteristics different from sporadic lymphomas and to attempt to identify a gene that confers an increased risk of lymphoma.","detailedDescription":"* Patients who participate will be asked to complete detailed family and medical history questionnaires initially, with a follow-up questionnaire every year.\n* Patients will be asked to supply a blood sample and possibly a mouthwash sample, both of which can be done by mail.\n* Patients will be asked to consent to the release of their lymphoma tissue block for the purposes of the study.\n* Patients will be given letters of invitation for their affected relatives to invite them to participate."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma","Hodgkin's Disease","Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic","Lymphoproliferative Disorders"],"keywords":["Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma","Hodgkin's disease","Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia","Lymphoproliferative disorder","Genetics"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"FAMILY_BASED","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"Whole blood Cheek cells Paraffin blocks of tumor tissue"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1500,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Next of Kin of deceased subj by lymphoma","description":"Next of Kin of deceased subject by lymphoma"},{"label":"Subject unaffected by lymphoma","description":"Subject unaffected by lymphoma"},{"label":"Subject affected by lymphoma","description":"Subject affected by lymphoma"}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Genetic factors that contribute to the development of lymphomas and CLL","description":"Genetic factors that contribute to the development of lymphomas and CLL","timeFrame":"Indefinite"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Any individual diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or Hodgkin's disease or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), who has a 1st degree relative (parent, sibling or child) with a lymphoproliferative disorder; or families in which the individual has a lymphoproliferative disorder, and an unusual clustering of frequent or premature solid tumors is also observed.\n* Family members of the individual, either affected or unaffected with lymphoma, who are contacted by the individual and agree to participate in the study.\n* Deceased family members may be included in the study.
