Tissue are analyzed for molecular features that predict biologic behavior. Quantitation of RNA, gene expression profiles, and protein expression patterns are assessed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectroscopy and microarray analysis.\n\nMedical records are reviewed to obtain information about results of tests associated with cancer diagnosis. Further progress in cancer treatment and tumor behavior after surgery are followed via record review."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Lung Cancer"],"keywords":["stage I non-small cell lung cancer","stage II non-small cell lung cancer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"Both prospective and retrospectives samples of blood and tissue."},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":4000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Resectable non-small cell lung cancer","description":"Patients with clinical stage I or II invasive lung cancer that can be completely removed by surgery and who have not undergone chemotherapy or radiotherapy before surgery","interventionNames":["Genetic: gene expression analysis","Genetic: microarray analysis","Genetic: protein expression analysis","Other: biologic sample preservation procedure","Other: laboratory biomarker analysis","Other: matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"GENETIC","name":"gene expression analysis","description":"Blood and lung tissue collection","armGroupLabels":["Resectable non-small cell lung cancer"]},{"type":"GENETIC","name":"microarray analysis","description":"Blood and lung tissue collection","armGroupLabels":["Resectable non-small cell lung cancer"]},{"type":"GENETIC","name":"protein expression analysis","description":"Blood and lung tissue collection","armGroupLabels":["Resectable non-small cell lung cancer"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"biologic sample preservation procedure","description":"Blood and lung tissue collection","armGroupLabels":["Resectable non-small cell lung cancer"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"laboratory biomarker analysis","description":"Blood and lung tissue collection","armGroupLabels":["Resectable non-small cell lung cancer"]},{"type":"OTHER","name":"matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry","description":"Blood and lung tissue collection","armGroupLabels":["Resectable non-small cell lung cancer"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Protein and RNA expression fingerprints from collected samples","timeFrame":"after collection of designated samples"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Development of statistical and computational methods to model relationship of data and clinical outcomes","timeFrame":"after laboratory gene analysis work is completed"},{"measure":"Correlation of protein and RNA expression fingerprints with recurrence (local and/or distant) and survival","timeFrame":"after collection of designated samples"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion criteria\n\n* Diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer\n\n  * Clinical stage I and II disease\n  * Resectable disease and complete surgical resection planned\n* Treated on companion studies at Vanderbilt University, the Veterans Administration hospital, St. Thomas, and Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center Affiliate Network\n* Tumor specimen samples must be available at resection\n\nExclusion criteria\n\n* Chemotherapy before surgery\n* Radiotherapy before surgery","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"120 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"People who have clinical stage I and II non-small cell lung cancer","samplingMethod":"PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"VICC Clinical Trials Information Program","role":"CONTACT","phone":"800-811-8480","email":"cip@vumc.org"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Eric Grogan, MD","affiliation":"Vanderbilt Medical Center","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Dan Rudy Cancer Center at Saint Thomas Hospital","status":"COMPLETED","city":"Nashville","state":"Tennessee","zip":"37205","country":"United States","geoPoint":{"lat":36.16589,"lon":-86.78444}},{"facility":"Veterans Affairs Medical Center -
