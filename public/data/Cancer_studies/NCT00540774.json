All different areas of the mouth will be imaged, including healthy, diseased, dysplastic and malignant, as well as oral biofilm, and the imaging data compared against conventional diagnostic approaches such clinical and histopathological and molecular evaluations to (1) gain a better understanding of processes involved in oral pathology and (2) develop a combined patient specific, non-invasive method for the detection, diagnosis and screening of oral pathology and biofilm. Thus our goal is to identify and evaluate microstructural, metabolic, vascular, protein, genomic and metabolomics biomarkers of oral pathology can be used to detect, predict and map oral pathology, especially neoplasia.\n\nWe are recruiting patients with a wide range of oral conditions including plaque, dry mouth, toothache, root canal treatments, gum disease, oral sores, dysplasia and cancer, autoimmune conditions and others as well as healthy control subjects. We will use a range of non-invasive imaging modalities to obtain information on the ways in which the oral health status affects optical properties, and determine means of detecting and quantifying these factors.. Imaging modalities to be utilized include:\n\n1. Coherence and Doppler Tomography\n2. Laser Speckle Imaging\n3. Various forms of Spectroscopy\n4. Fluorescence","detailedDescription":"Purpose of the research is to identify optical predictors and biomarkers of health and disease.\n\nHypothesis: microstructural, metabolic, vascular, protein, genomic and metabolomics biomarkers of oral pathology can be used to detect, predict and map oral pathology, especially neoplasia.\n\nResearchers of the Beckman Laser Institute (BLI) have developed many non-invasive imaging modalities for assessment of oral tissue. This protocol will allow data acquisition with these multiple modalities to allow validation of data. Imaging modalities to be utilized include:\n\n1. Coherence and Doppler Tomography (OCT)\n2. Laser Speckle Imaging (LSI)\n3. Photon Migration Spectroscopy (PMS)\n4. Autofluorescence Imaging\n\nIn addition, saliva samples from the patients will be analyzed and the resulting data regarding the dysregulation in the activities of genes, proteins and other molecules will be correlated with findings from different imaging systems with respect to the stage of oral carcinogenesis."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Mouth Diseases"],"keywords":["Oral cancer","Oral mucositis","Periodontitis","Dry mouth","Gingivitis","Oral lesions","Dental Hard Tissues","Oral Biofilm"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE","maskingDescription":"No masking other than an anonymization of data."}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":2500,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Oral tissue","type":"OTHER","description":"Imaging of oral structures and pathologies","interventionNames":["Device: detection of oral pathology"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"detection of oral pathology","description":"detection of oral pathology","armGroupLabels":["Oral tissue"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Healthy oral tissue","description":"Develop a non-invasive tool for the detection, diagnosis and screening of oral pathology and understanding of processes involved in oral pathology","timeFrame":"up to 12 months"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Male or Female age 18 years and older\n* Have oral lesion or not have oral lesion\n* Have condition of dry mouth\n* Have condition of Gum disease\n* Non-smoker\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Age less than 18 years old\n* Advanced gum disease, diseases of oral tissue\n* Untreated cavities\n* Pregnant or breastfeeding\n* Immune compromised individuals","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"18 Years","maximumAge":"75 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Nicole Wakida, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"949-824-4360","email":"nwakida@uci.edu"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Petra Wilder-Smith, DDS, PhD","affiliation":"University of Calfornia Irvine","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Beckman Laser Institute and Medical Clinic","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Irvine","state":"California","zip":"92612","country":"United States","contacts":[{"name":"Nicole Wakida, PhD","role":"CONTACT","phone":"949-824-4360","email":"nwakida@uci.edu"},{"name":"Petra Wilder-Smith, DDS, PhD","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":33.66946,"lon":-117.82311}}]}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-08-28"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000009059","term":"Mouth Diseases"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000009057","term":"Stomatognathic Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M13427","name":"Periodontitis","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M9003","name":"Gingivitis","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M26955","name":"Mucositis","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12022","name":"Mouth Neoplasms","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M17724","name":"Xerostomia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12019","name":"Mouth Diseases","asFound":"Mouth Disease","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M16070","name":"Stomatitis","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M12017","name":"Stomatognathic Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T4265","name":"Oral Cancer","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"T3466","name":"Lip and Oral Cavity Cancer","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC07","name":"Mouth and Tooth Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC01","name":"Infections"},{"abbrev":"BC06","name":"Digestive System Diseases"},{"abbrev":"BC04","name":"Neoplasms"},{"abbrev":"Rare","name":"Rare Diseases"}]}},"hasResults":false}
