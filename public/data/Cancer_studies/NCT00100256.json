This will be done by first treating patients at relatively low doses of Rhenium Re 188 P2045, observing them closely to assure that there are no bad side effects, then increasing the dose when we are confident that it is safe to do so.","detailedDescription":"We want to learn more about the side effect profile of both Technetium Tc 99m P2045 and Rhenium Re 188 P2045 and will do that by observing you closely after you receive the drug and by conducting multiple tests, as well as by asking you how you feel. We want to also learn if there is any benefit, in terms of lung cancer tumor reduction, as a result of treatment with Rhenium Re 188 P2045. This study has previously been posted by Berlex, Inc. Andarix Pharmaceuticals is the sponsor of the trial."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Lung Neoplasms","Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung","Carcinoma, Small Cell","Neoplasm Recurrence, Local"],"keywords":["Advanced or recurrent stage IIIb or IV non small cell lung cancer","Disseminated or recurrent small cell lung cancer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":60,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Arm 1","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: Rhenium (Re 188 P2045, BAY86-5284)"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Rhenium (Re 188 P2045, BAY86-5284)","description":"Infusion once only","armGroupLabels":["Arm 1"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Maximum tolerated dose of Rhenium 188 P2045","description":"Toxicity as determined by the analysis protocol","timeFrame":"Over the first month post dose administration"},{"measure":"Safety of Technetium Tc 99m P2045 and Rhenium Re 188 P2045","description":"Examination of clinical chemistry indicators as outlined in the protocol","timeFrame":"Up to one year post study completion"},{"measure":"Progression free survival in treated patients","description":"Analyze tumor and disease progression after dosing","timeFrame":"Up to one year post study completion"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Has histologically or cytologically documented Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) or Small-Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) and has advanced or recurrent IIIb or IV NSCLC (adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, large cell, mixed or not otherwise specified) or disseminated or recurrent SCLC or any lung cancer which has local recurrence.\n* Has documentation of progressive disease following prior chemotherapy or who refused to receive standard chemotherapy.\n* Has measurable tumor (at least 1 cm unidimensionally) in a previously non-irradiated area or, if in previously irradiated area, a substantial increase in size of tumor, based on CT scan within 8 weeks prior to enrollment;
