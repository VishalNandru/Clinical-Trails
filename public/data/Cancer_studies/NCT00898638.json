Buccal swabs and/or mouthwash samples and saliva samples are collected. Patients also undergo blood sample collection at baseline and then every 2-6 months thereafter.\n\nHealthy participants contribute blood samples, buccal swabs, and mouthwash samples at baseline only.\n\nInformation about medical and family history and cancer risk factors is also collected.\n\nPROJECTED ACCRUAL: No limit.\n\nFOLLOW UP: Indefinite, until date of death or lost to follow
