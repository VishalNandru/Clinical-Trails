Blood samples may be collected at the time of the initial visit and at periodic intervals during the course of the disease. These samples will be stored in the tissue bank of the Urologic Oncology Branch. Aliquots of malignant and normal tissue will be collected at the time of surgery and stored in the tissue bank, Urologic Oncology Branch, NCI. These materials will be used in the research efforts of the Urologic Oncology Branch, NCI.","detailedDescription":"Background\n\nKidney, prostate, bladder, testis and penile cancer account for 22% of cancers diagnosed in the United States and are responsible for 10% of cancer deaths each year in the U.S. Understanding the genes and gene pathways that cause genitourinary malignancies will provide the foundation for the development of targeted therapeutic agents for patients affected with these cancers. Since 1982 investigators in the Urologic Oncology Branch have been studying the genetic basis of urologic cancers. The identification of the genes for cancer of the kidney has led to the approval by the FDA of a number of new agents for patients with advanced disease. It is our goal to study the cancer gene pathways of genitourinary malignancies in order to further understand the cancer gene pathways that cause these diseases.\n\nObjectives\n\nCollection of benign and malignant tissue from patients with known or suspected cancer\n\nCollection of benign and malignant tissue from patients with rare inherited conditions associated with an increased risk for kidney cancer\n\nDetermine the molecular genetic differences between normal and tumorigenic tissues\n\nInvestigate the categories of genes/ biochemical pathways such as those that influence the cell cycle, angiogenesis, metabolic changes, and metastatic potential\n\nExamine protein expression and bioimmunoassays investigating potential genetic markers\n\nInvestigate cellular/biochemical response to existing and novel therapeutic agents.\n\nInvestigate quality of life in men who have prostate cancer\n\nInvestigate molecular genetic basis of urologic malignancies\n\nExamine cell free DNA and circulating tumor DNA for cancer gene mutations\n\nEligibility\n\nPatients with biopsy-proven malignant disease\n\nPatients suspected of having malignant disease\n\nPatients with known or suspected inherited urologic malignant disorder\n\nFamily members (related by blood) of patients who have or are suspected of having an inherited genitourinary disorder or malignancy\n\nFamily members of patients with a DNA variant\n\nDesign\n\nPatients will be screened for eligibility in the Urologic Oncology Branch Clinic\n\nBlood and urine samples may be obtained\n\nNormal and malignant tissue may be collected from patients undergoing clinically indicated surgical procedures\n\nBasic scientific research will be performed on collected specimens\n\nPatients will have the option to be contacted if a result is detected that would affect their health and they will be given the opportunity to be evaluated and re-tested on an IRB approved protocol if available\n\nGermline and somatic whole genome exome sequencing may be performed"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Malignant Neoplasms","Hereditary Neoplastic Syndromes","Kidney Cancer","Renal Cancer","Bladder Cancer"],"keywords":["Serum","Collection of Tissue","Malignant Disease","Molecular Basis","Genome Sequencing","Natural History"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":5950,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Family Members","description":"Family members (related by blood) of patients who have or are suspected of having a malignant disease or an inherited genitourinary malignant disorder"},{"label":"Patients","description":"Patients with biopsy-proven malignant diseases;
