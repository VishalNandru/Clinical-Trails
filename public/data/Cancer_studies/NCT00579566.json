To study these cells we need to have human tissue. You will be having or have already had a procedure to remove tissue. We would like to use some of this tissue. We will use it for laboratory studies on the diagnosis,behavior and treatment of sarcoma. We will perform an extensive analysis of your samples. We will only use extra tissue left over after all needed testing has been done or remove an additional small amount of tissue if you are having a biopsy. We will also take blood samples before and/or after your procedure to measure biochemical factors that may help us predict the behavior of sarcoma.","detailedDescription":"In this protocol, we plan to identify specific markers from biochemical, proteomic, epigenetic and molecular genetic analyses that predict clinical outcome, responsiveness to therapy and might serve as promising therapeutic targets in patients with soft tissue sarcoma."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Sarcoma"],"keywords":["Biochemical Determinants","Molecular Determinants"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"Tissue, Blood"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":3000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"1","description":"Sarcoma patients undergoing core biopsy, incisional biopsy or definitive surgical resection for soft tissue masses of extremity, trunk or retroperitoneum","interventionNames":["Other: Specimen protocol"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Specimen protocol","description":"The research specimen will be obtained from the residual specimen that would otherwise be discarded per usual hospital procedure.","armGroupLabels":["1"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"establish and maintain a specimen bank and sarcoma cell line resource","description":"for laboratory-based studies on the causes, prevention, diagnosis and treatment of human soft tissue sarcoma","timeFrame":"2 years"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"identify new rational therapeutic targets","timeFrame":"2 years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* All patients with known or suspected sarcoma who will have or have had tissue removed for therapeutic or diagnostic purposes.\n* Patients will be entered without preference for any particular racial/ethnic group or gender.\n* Patients may have received prior hormonal therapy, cytotoxic chemotherapy, irradiation, immunotherapy or surgical therapy.\n* Tissue specimens must be large enough in quantity to allow routine pathologic analysis, with the research laboratory specimen removed from the residual specimen, which would otherwise be discarded.
