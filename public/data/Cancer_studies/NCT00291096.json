To correlate established risk biomarkers such as cytomorphology obtained from random periareolar fine needle aspiration ( RPFNA), mammographic breast density, serum bioavailable estradiol and IGF-1/IGFBP-3 with each other and with 5-10 year Gail risk estimates. Where available, and with appropriate safe guards to maintain status for breast cancer susceptibility genes may be included.\n2. To determine the relative predictive value of established risk biomarkers for the development of DCIS and/or invasive cancer.\n3. To evaluate potential new breast tissue-based biomarkers including Ki-67, PCNA, ER, COX-2, aromatase, methylation of key tumor suppressor genes (i.e., RAR, p16, etc), proteomic patterns in RPFNA and nipple aspirate fluid (NAF), as well as NAF hormone levels, and correlate them with other risk biomarkers listed in 1.\n4. To determine the prevalence of polymorphisms of a panel of genes important in hormone and xenobiotic metabolism as well as DNA repair and correlate these polymorphisms with established risk biomarkers listed in 1, as well as with development of DCIS and invasive cancer.\n5. To maintain contact with this initially identified cohort of high risk women, acquire demographic data, biologic specimens and data and follow them prospectively for the development."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Breast Cancer"],"keywords":["breast atypia","fine needle aspiration","high risk for breast cancer","breast epithelial hyperplasia"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITHOUT_DNA","description":"RPFNA specimens, serum, NAF"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":3000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Prediction of risk for developing breast cancer","description":"development of algorithm for predicting risk for developing breast cancer based on random sampling of benign breast tissue.","timeFrame":"ongoing"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* women with at least 2 times the normal risk of developing breast cancer\n* between the ages of 30-65 (or within 10 years of youngest age at diagnosis in first degree relative)\n* greater than six months from ingestion of antihormonal therapy\n* greater than 1 year from pregnancy, lactation, or chemotherapy\n* willing to have a mammogram within six months prior to RPFNA\n* willing to discontinue NSAIDS or herbal supplements\n* willing to have blood drawn\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* no metastatic malignancy of any kind\n* no breast implants or tram flap reconstructions\n* no radiation to both breasts\n* no women who have a current mammogram or clinical breast exam suspicious for cancer","healthyVolunteers":true,"sex":"FEMALE","minimumAge":"30 Years","maximumAge":"65 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"],"studyPopulation":"Self-identified women at high risk for development of breast cancer","samplingMethod":"NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE"},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Bruce Kimler, Ph.D.","role":"CONTACT","phone":"913-588-4523","email":"bkimler@kumc.edu"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Carol J Fabian, MD","affiliation":"University of Kansas Medical Center","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"University of Kansas Medical Center","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Kansas City","state":"Kansas","zip":"66160","country":"United States","contacts":[{"name":"Carol J Fabian, MD","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Bruce Kimler, PhD","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":39.11417,"lon":-94.62746}}]},"ipdSharingStatementModule":{"ipdSharing":"NO"}},"derivedSection":{"miscInfoModule":{"versionHolder":"2024-08-28"},"conditionBrowseModule":{"meshes":[{"id":"D000001943","term":"Breast Neoplasms"}],"ancestors":[{"id":"D000009371","term":"Neoplasms by Site"},{"id":"D000009369","term":"Neoplasms"},{"id":"D000001941","term":"Breast Diseases"},{"id":"D000012871","term":"Skin Diseases"}],"browseLeaves":[{"id":"M5220","name":"Breast Neoplasms","asFound":"Breast Cancer","relevance":"HIGH"},{"id":"M10016","name":"Hyperplasia","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M5218","name":"Breast Diseases","relevance":"LOW"},{"id":"M15674","name":"Skin Diseases","relevance":"LOW"}],"browseBranches":[{"abbrev":"BC04","name":"Neoplasms"},{"abbrev":"BC17","name":"Skin and Connective Tissue Diseases"},{"abbrev":"All","name":"All Conditions"},{"abbrev":"BC23","name":"Symptoms and General Pathology"}]}},"hasResults":false}
