No experimental evaluations or treatments are offered. Patient evaluations include a medical history, review of medical records and routine physical examination. Based on the findings, other procedures may be recommended, including blood tests, urine tests, and imaging tests, such as X-rays, bone densitometry, bone scan, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\n\nBone specimens from participants will be collected for research use. Specimens will be obtained from bone removed during a patient s planned surgical procedure performed for medical care, or patients may be requested to have a bone biopsy removal of a small piece of bone tissue as part of the patient evaluation procedure.","detailedDescription":"Study Description:\n\nTo evaluate participants with bone and mineral disorders at the NIH Clinical Center and obtain tissue and clinical specimens from outside institutions\n\nObjectives:\n\nPrimary Objective:\n\nProvide a protocol within which participants with common and rare disorders of bone and mineral metabolism can be studied, evaluated and treated at NIH.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\nTo obtain tissue and clinical specimens (including but not limited to blood, urine, nucleic acids, skin and bone) and data collected at outside institutions and the NIH Clinical Center from participants with various bone and mineral disorders.\n\nTertiary/Exploratory Objective:\n\nGenerate a pool of participants with bone and mineral disorders, from which research questions could arise and future clinical research studies may be generated.\n\nEndpoints:\n\nPrimary Endpoint:\n\nMedical evaluation with clinical assessments performed at time points specific to each participant s diagnosis. Analysis of research and participant outcome data will be performed.\n\nSecondary Endpoint:\n\nGenetic and/or biochemical assessments of surgical waste material from the NIH Clinical Center or other medical facilities.\n\nTertiary/Exploratory Endpoint:\n\nDevelopment of a database containing information from enrolled participants with bone and mineral disorders and annotated specimens and data."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Tumor Induced Osteomalcia","Osteomalacia","Familial Tumoral Calcinosis"],"keywords":["Natural History","skeletal diseases","Osteoporosis","Dysplasia","Osteomalacia","Bone Diseases","Skeletal Disease"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_ONLY","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"1","description":"Subjects with known or suspected bone disease and disorder of mineral metabolism."}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Collection of clinical and research specimens","description":"Specimens will be collected for creating better understanding of the disorders seen and for generating future research studies.","timeFrame":"10 years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"* INCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\nThe study population will include participants with known or suspected bone disease and/or with a known or suspected disorder of mineral metabolism.
