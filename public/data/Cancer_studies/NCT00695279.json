The FDA has recommended methods to assess the risk of delayed adverse events after GT/GM and has provided specific requirements regarding the duration and design of LTFU observations. This protocol is intended to provide LTFU in accordance with the FDA guidelines for those who received a GT/GM product as part of a St. Jude-sponsored clinical trial or compassionate use treatment plan. The protocol calls for a physical examination or general health evaluation and collection of required blood samples annually for up to 15 years after the last receipt of a GT/GM product.\n\nGoals will be to obtain clinical histories in order to detect late clinical outcomes suggestive of retroviral or lentiviral disease, including but not limited to cancer/second malignancies, neurologic disorders, autoimmune disorders, and hematologic disorders. Blood samples will be archived and tested when clinically or scientifically indicated, as in the event of development of a second malignancy. This prospective cohort study will utilize descriptive statistics in the analysis of long-term late effects outcomes. It offers a uniform approach to long-term safety monitoring in research participants who have received a gene-transduced product as part of St. Jude-sponsored GT or GM protocols and compassionate use treatment plans.","detailedDescription":"Secondary objectives include the following: to obtain and archive blood samples to 1) detect frequency of vector marking in peripheral blood mononuclear cells when clinically or scientifically indicated, such as in the event of participant development of second malignancy, autoimmune disease, hematologic abnormality, or neurologic event, and; 2) To obtain and archive blood samples to detect and characterize clonal proliferation events occurring in gene transfer trials when clinically or scientifically indicated."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Severe Combined Immunodeficiency","Malignancy, Hematologic","Neuroblastoma","Neoplasm","Mucopolysaccharidosis I"],"keywords":["Gene therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"Blood samples"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Participants","description":"Venipuncture","interventionNames":["Procedure: Venipuncture"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"PROCEDURE","name":"Venipuncture","description":"Blood draw","armGroupLabels":["Participants"],"otherNames":["Follow-Up Studies","Prospective Studies","Cancer vaccines","Biological Specimen Banks"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Obtain histories for detection of significant delayed medical events in research participants who have received an integrating vector-based gene therapy/gene marked product at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH).","description":"Obtain histories for detection of significant delayed medical events including hematologic, malignant, autoimmune, and neurologic events in research participants who have received an integrating vector-based gene therapy/gene marked product at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH).","timeFrame":"30 years"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Has received an integrating retroviral or lentiviral vector based GT/GM product at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital within the past 15 year time period.
