This study will assess these two different methods to determine if there is a notable decrease in the amount of drainage with one versus the other.","detailedDescription":"Lymph node dissection is an integral part of the surgical management of lung cancer. Knowledge of lymph node status plays a key role in therapeutic decision making and prognosis. Associated with this dissection comes the propensity for lymphatic leakage, increased chest tube drainage, prolonged retention of chest tubes in the postoperative period and increased patient length of stay. Our center performs complete mediastinal node dissection of all relevant regional lymph nodes which generally include paratracheal, pretracheal, subcarinal, hilar and paraesophageal nodes. The current standard of practice for the dissection of the lymph nodes includes the use of the Harmonic Scalpel or electrocautery. Known risk of electrocautery include localized nerve damage, cardiac arrhythmias and damage to the tissue sample/specimen that is used for pathology. The Harmonic Scalpel technology has recently become available for use. Current experience with the Harmonic Scalpel suggests that there is less localized nerve damage, less incidence of arrhythmias, less damage to the tissue sample and less lymph leakage. There is no published data to support this hypothesis, thus the purpose of this study."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Lung Cancer"],"keywords":["Lung cancer","Lymph node dissection"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":50,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Group A","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Electrocautery used for dissection.","interventionNames":["Device: Electrocautery"]},{"label":"Group B","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Harmonic Scalpel used for dissection","interventionNames":["Device: Harmonic ACE23P Scalpel"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Harmonic ACE23P Scalpel","description":"Lymph node dissection","armGroupLabels":["Group B"]},{"type":"DEVICE","name":"Electrocautery","armGroupLabels":["Group A"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Amount of chest tube drainage","timeFrame":"daily"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Pleural effusions monitored by chest x-ray.","timeFrame":"Every other day and at four weeks"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients undergoing resection for stage 1, 2 or 3A lung cancer.\n* Patients between the ages of 20-75.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* History of Congestive Heart Failure.\n* History of renal failure, ie., creatinine greater than 2.2.\n* Patients with bulky or matted lymph nodes in stage 3A.\n* Current pregnancy.\n* Current participation in another study involving an investigational device or drug.","healthyVolunteers":false,"sex":"ALL","minimumAge":"20 Years","maximumAge":"75 Years","stdAges":["ADULT","OLDER_ADULT"]},"contactsLocationsModule":{"centralContacts":[{"name":"Laura Pine, RN, BSN","role":"CONTACT","phone":"757-388-2732","email":"ljpine@sentara.com"},{"name":"Michelle Collier, RN, BSN","role":"CONTACT","phone":"757-388-7511","email":"mlcollie@sentara.com"}],"overallOfficials":[{"name":"Joseph Newton, MD","affiliation":"Sentara Cardiovascular Research Institute","role":"PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR"}],"locations":[{"facility":"Sentara Norfolk General Hospital/Sentara Heart Hospital","status":"RECRUITING","city":"Norfolk","state":"Virginia","zip":"23507","country":"United States","contacts":[{"name":"Laura Pine, RN, BSN","role":"CONTACT","phone":"757-388-2732","email":"ljpine@sentara.com"},{"name":"Michelle Collier, RN, BSN","role":"CONTACT","phone":"757-388-7511","email":"mlcollie@sentara.com"},{"name":"Kirk Fleischer, MD","role":"SUB_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Michael McGrath, MD","role":"SUB_INVESTIGATOR"},{"name":"Jeffrey Rich, MD","role":"SUB_INVESTIGATOR"}],"geoPoint":{"lat":36.84681,"lon":-76.28522}}]},"referencesModule":{"references":[{"pmid":"12184902","type":"BACKGROUND","citation":"Holub Z, Jabor A, Kliment L, Lukac J, Voracek J.
