Participants complete two baseline surveys regarding their personal, family, health, and environmental exposure histories and regarding their opinions on cancer and cancer screening. Patients also complete a follow-up survey at 1 year and undergo review of their medical records."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Familial Pancreatic Cancer"],"keywords":["family","history","pancreas","cancer","melanoma","genetic"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"FAMILY_BASED","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"bioSpec":{"retention":"SAMPLES_WITH_DNA","description":"Two 10mL plasma tubes and two 10mL serum tubes collected.
